# Odin Kittens

This was a fast and straightforward project where I set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API. This meant that my controller methods rendered data instead of HTML. This was a quick way to be introduced into building a pure vanilla RESTful resource. I used the ``rest-client`` gem and rendered my controller methods with JSON.
